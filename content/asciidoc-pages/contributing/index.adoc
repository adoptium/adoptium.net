Thanks for your interest in this project.

== Project description

Adoptium is an open-source project that focuses on providing high-quality, production-ready distributions of the Java Development Kit (JDK) and associated technologies. The project's main goal is to create a vendor-neutral, community-driven distribution of OpenJDK, which is the open-source implementation of the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE).

Adoptium aims to provide users with reliable and well-tested builds of OpenJDK across different platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and more. The project collaborates closely with the OpenJDK community and benefits from the expertise of a diverse group of contributors, including developers, organizations, and Java enthusiasts.

One of the key objectives of Adoptium is to make it easier for developers and organizations to access and consume OpenJDK builds. It provides prebuilt binaries that are thoroughly tested, ensuring stability and compatibility. These binaries are available for free, making it convenient for developers to adopt and use OpenJDK in their projects without any licensing restrictions.

Adoptium also offers long-term support (LTS) builds, which are specifically designed for enterprises and organizations that require a stable and reliable Java runtime environment. The LTS builds receive regular updates and security patches, ensuring the longevity and maintenance of the Java platform.

Overall, Adoptium aims to provide a trustworthy and accessible distribution of OpenJDK, promoting transparency, collaboration, and community-driven innovation within the Java ecosystem.
