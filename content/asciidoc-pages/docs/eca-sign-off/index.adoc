== Sign the Eclipse Contributor Agreement
To contribute to this project the https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php[Eclipse Contributor Agreement (ECA)] must be signed.
This document will walk you through this process.

First, you need to create an Eclipse Foundation account.

. Go to the https://accounts.eclipse.org/user/register[Eclipse Registration page]
. Fill all Required fields and submit
** Eclipse expects you to use the entered E-Mail address for every contribution, e.q. user.email for git
. Activate your account via the activation link in your mailbox
** The sender should be *webmaster@eclipse.org* with the subject *Eclipse Account Registration*

You are one step away from becoming an Eclipse Contributor, we just need to sign the ECA.

=== Sign the ECA
Signing the ECA is straightforward and is done online.

. Navigate to the https://accounts.eclipse.org/user/login[login page] of Eclipse Accounts page
. Login with your E-Mail address and password
. Eclipse Accounts navigates you directly to the sign page
** Read the https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php[ECA]
** Enter the requested information
** Submit via *Accept* button

Now the Status panel in the upper right corner should show that you signed the Eclipse Contributor Agreement. It should look like this:

=== ECA Sign check failed, but why?
For every pull request, a GitHub Action verifies that the author signed the Eclipse Contributor Agreement.
This can fail if:

* You have not got an Eclipse Account
* You have not signed the Eclipse Contributor Agreement
* You have configured git to use a different E-Mail address than you used to sign the ECA
** `user.email` setting for git must equal to that used for your Eclipse Foundation account. See https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address[Setting your commit email address] for more information

If none of the above is the case, feel free to reach out to the maintainers.

=== How to change the author E-Mail address for existing commits
In order for the ECA check to pass, all commits in the pull request must have been authored with the E-Mail address used to sign the ECA.

To change the author for the last commit:

[source, bash]
----
git commit --amend --author 'Author Name <author.name@mail.com>' --no-edit
----

To change the author for the last N commits:

[source, bash]
----
git rebase -i HEAD~4 -x "git commit --amend --author 'Author Name <author.name@mail.com>' --no-edit"
----
