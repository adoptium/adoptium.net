== Overview

The Adoptium Marketplace provides users easy access to a wide variety of high-quality fully compatible OpenJDK Java binaries, and provides the organizations producing those binaries a mechanism to broaden the distribution of their Java runtimes.

=== User Benefits

Every binary available via the Adoptium marketplace
link:/marketplace[website]
and
https://marketplace-api.adoptium.net/q/swagger-ui/[API^]
is Java SE compatible and has demonstrated that it is ready for production use in a wide variety of environments by passing the
link:/aqavit[AQAvit^]
quality verification suite.

The
https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/adoptium.aqavit[AQAvit verification suite^]
evaluates Java runtimes for functional correctness, performance, resilience, security, and the ability to pass a wide variety of application test suites. As a result, enterprises are provided with a higher degree of confidence in the binaries they’re bringing into their companies and incorporating into their software supply chains.

=== Producer Benefits

The following benefits are enjoyed by all producers listed in the Adoptium marketplace.

 * Demonstrates that their product is a high quality offering, ready for enterprise usage, having passed the required Java-compatibility and AQAvit quality inclusion criteria.
 * Shows their product meets all the Eclipse Adoptium Working Group requirements for security, scalability, durability, and functional correctness at a specific version and build.
 * Declares the provider is a participant in the Adoptium community and supports the definition and scope of the AQAvit quality criteria across the industry.
 * Listed products benefit from Adoptium Working Group sponsored marketing and promotion initiatives across the industry with the support of the Eclipse Foundation.
 
Inclusion in the marketplace is open to all strategic and enterprise members of the Adoptium working group at no additional cost to the provider, is non-exclusive, and preserves the opportunity to supply paid services alongside the offering.

== AQAvit Software Product Verification

Only those products that pass the AQAVit software product verification test suite and comply with the obligations of the
https://www.eclipse.org/legal/eclipse-foundation-quality-verification-suite-license.php[Eclipse Foundation Quality Verification Suite License^]
may be included in the Adoptium Marketplace.

It is necessary to
link:/aqavit[verify every binary]
that wishes to be included in the Adoptium Marketplace. It is not necessary to be an Adoptium working group member to produce an AQAvit verified software product.

== Java SE Compatibility

Compliance with the Java SE Specification is determined exclusively through the use of Oracle’s
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_Compatibility_Kit[Technology Compatibility Kit^]
(TCK) for the Java Platform, also referred to as the Java Compatibility Kit (JCK).

The JCK test kit is the property of Oracle, and is not available under an open source license. Eclipse does not test third-party software products for Java compatibility. Producers should approach Oracle to secure their own license to use the JCK for such purposes.
