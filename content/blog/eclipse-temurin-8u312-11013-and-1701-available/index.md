## New and Noteworthy

### Eclipse Temurin 11 for Alpine Linux with musl libc

We previously [announced Temurin 17 binaries for Alpine Linux](https://adoptium.net/blog/2021/09/eclipse-temurin-17-available/). We're pleased to announce that we have added support for Temurin 11 binaries as well. These can either be downloaded via the [adoptium.net](https://adoptium.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=hotspot) or used in our [Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-temurin/):

```bash
➜  ~ docker run -it eclipse-temurin:11-alpine java --version
openjdk 11.0.13 2021-10-19
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-11.0.13+8 (build 11.0.13+8)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-11.0.13+8 (build 11.0.13+8, mixed mode)
```

### New artifacts in the releases

We now publish source and static versions of the Temurin libraries (JDK11+) as well as source code archives. Source code archives can be downloaded via the adoptium.net or the API.
