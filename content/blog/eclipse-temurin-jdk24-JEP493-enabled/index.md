The upcoming release of Eclipse Temurin 24.0.0+36 will have [JEP
493](https://openjdk.org/jeps/493) enabled. Note: It's disabled by default.
That is, the JDK 24 release archive of Eclipse Temurin will be about 35%
smaller. The installed size on-disk will be about 15% smaller. It also means
that the release no longer includes the `jmods` folder. That folder included
packaged modules of the JDK and was being used when running the `jlink`
command.

JEP 493 enhances the JDK to use `jlink` without needing the `jmods` folder (or
packaged modules). `jlink` will work as before for most use-cases. For example,
in order to create a custom runtime with only `java.se` modules one could
create such a runtime as before with the following command (note: the
`--verbose` option was added for explicitness):

```bash
$ ./jdk-24+36/bin/jlink --add-modules java.se \
       --output jdk-24.se-only --verbose

As you can see, `jlink` still works. For some of the more uncommon use-cases we
provide some frequently asked questions below that you might find helpful.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Won't jlink no longer work without JMODs?

This is what JEP 493 changes. Since Eclipse Temurin 24 enables the feature at
build time, `jlink` will link from the runtime image and will, therefore, no
longer need JMODs for creating custom runtimes. The user experience is the same
when using jlink.  One can check with `jlink --help` that JEP 493 is enabled:

```bash
$ ./jdk-24+36/bin/jlink --help | tail -n2
Capabilities:
      Linking from run-time image enabled
```

### Using jpackage fails with: "jlink failed with: Error: This JDK does not contain packaged modules and cannot be used to create another image with the jdk.jlink module"

Linking from the runtime image doesn't allow including the `jdk.jlink` module
itself. See "Restrictions" in the [JEP](https://openjdk.org/jeps/493). Since
the `jdk.jlink` module, with JEP 493 enabled, includes extra data needed for
linking from the runtime image, it has been decided to prevent such multi-hop
`jlink` runs.

With that said, this is actually a `jpackage`
[bug](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8345185). `jpackage` ought not to
perform service bindings for providers in the set of modules that get linked
into a default runtime that `jpackage` generates under the hood. The bug,
[JDK-8345185](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8345185), has been fixed in
JDK 24.0.2 (July 2025 release). Until then, it's suggested to pass required
modules for your application with the `--add-modules` option of `jpackage`.
Note that the `DEFAULT-MODULE-PATH` set for JDK 24 without service bindings
that JDK 24.0.2 would use is (modulo some application specific modules):

```bash
java.rmi,jdk.management.jfr,jdk.jdi,jdk.xml.dom,java.xml,java.datatransfer,
jdk.httpserver,java.desktop,java.security.sasl,jdk.zipfs,java.base,jdk.javadoc,
jdk.management.agent,jdk.jshell,jdk.jsobject,java.sql.rowset,jdk.sctp,
jdk.unsupported,java.smartcardio,java.security.jgss,java.compiler,jdk.nio.mapmode,
jdk.dynalink,jdk.unsupported.desktop,jdk.accessibility,jdk.security.jgss,
jdk.incubator.vector,java.sql,java.transaction.xa,java.logging,java.xml.crypto,
jdk.jfr,jdk.internal.md,jdk.net,java.naming,jdk.internal.ed,java.prefs,
java.net.http,jdk.compiler,jdk.internal.opt,jdk.jconsole,jdk.attach,
jdk.internal.le,java.management,jdk.jdwp.agent,jdk.internal.jvmstat,
java.instrument,jdk.management,jdk.security.auth,java.scripting,jdk.jartool,
java.management.rmi
```

### Generating a runtime using jlink with ALL-MODULE-PATH no longer seems to work

When I run `jlink --add-modules ALL-MODULE-PATH --output myimage` I get:

```output
Error: --module-path option must be specified with --add-modules ALL-MODULE-PATH
```

The relevant upstream OpenJDK change is
[JDK-8345259](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8345259). Prior to JDK 24,
using `--add-modules ALL-MODULE-PATH` was equivalent to `--add-modules
ALL-MODULE-PATH --module-path $JAVA_HOME/jmods` which essentially meant to
create a runtime with *all* JDK modules. If this is what you intended to get a
"smaller" runtime, then a similar result could be achieved by:

1. Taking a JDK 24 Eclipse Temurin installation, copy it to a new location.
   Note that it already doesn't include the `jmods` folder.
2. Removing the `src.zip` file from the `lib` folder (~51 MB)

If you are really interested in smaller custom runtimes, however, you should
not include *all* JDK modules. I.e. consider using explicit modules in
`--add-modules` clause instead.
