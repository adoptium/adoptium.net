The releases of Eclipse Temurin 24.0.0+36 and newer will have [JEP
493](https://openjdk.org/jeps/493) enabled. Note: This functionality is
disabled by default for JDK 24 builds and has to be explicitly enabled at build
time. Since Eclipse Temurin 24 enables the JEP functionality, the JDK 24
release archive of Eclipse Temurin will be about 35% smaller. The installed
size on-disk will be about 15% smaller. It also means that the release no
longer includes the `jmods` folder. That folder included packaged modules of
the JDK and was being used when running the `jlink` command.

JEP 493 enhances the JDK to use `jlink` without needing the `jmods` folder (or
packaged modules). `jlink` will work as before for most use-cases. For example,
in order to create a custom runtime with only `java.se` modules one could
create such a runtime as before with the following command (note: the
`--verbose` option was added for explicitness):

```bash
$ ./jdk-24+36/bin/jlink --add-modules java.se \
       --output jdk-24.se-only --verbose

As you can see, `jlink` still works. For some of the more uncommon use-cases we
provide some frequently asked questions below that you might find helpful.

Should you run into problems with this feature, please report a bug about it here:
https://github.com/adoptium/adoptium-support/issues

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Won't jlink no longer work without JMODs?

This is what JEP 493 changes. Since Eclipse Temurin 24 enables the feature at
build time, `jlink` will link from the runtime image and will, therefore, no
longer need JMODs for creating custom runtimes. The user experience is the same
when using jlink.  One can check with `jlink --help` that JEP 493 is enabled:

```bash
$ ./jdk-24+36/bin/jlink --help | tail -n2
Capabilities:
      Linking from run-time image enabled
```

### Using jpackage fails with: "jlink failed with: Error: This JDK does not contain packaged modules and cannot be used to create another image with the jdk.jlink module"

Linking from the runtime image doesn't allow including the `jdk.jlink` module
itself. See "Restrictions" in the [JEP](https://openjdk.org/jeps/493). Since
the `jdk.jlink` module, with JEP 493 enabled, includes extra data needed for
linking from the runtime image, it has been decided to prevent such multi-hop
`jlink` runs.

With that said, this is actually a `jpackage`
[bug](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8345185). `jpackage` ought not to
perform service bindings for providers in the set of modules that get linked
into a default runtime that `jpackage` generates under the hood. The bug,
[JDK-8345185](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8345185), has been fixed in
JDK 24.0.2 (July 2025 release). Until then, it's suggested to pass required
modules for your application with the `--add-modules` option of `jpackage`.
Note that the `DEFAULT-MODULE-PATH` set for JDK 24 without service bindings
that JDK 24.0.2 would use is (modulo some application specific modules):

```bash
java.rmi,jdk.management.jfr,jdk.jdi,jdk.xml.dom,java.xml,java.datatransfer,
jdk.httpserver,java.desktop,java.security.sasl,jdk.zipfs,java.base,jdk.javadoc,
jdk.management.agent,jdk.jshell,jdk.jsobject,java.sql.rowset,jdk.sctp,
jdk.unsupported,java.smartcardio,java.security.jgss,java.compiler,jdk.nio.mapmode,
jdk.dynalink,jdk.unsupported.desktop,jdk.accessibility,jdk.security.jgss,
jdk.incubator.vector,java.sql,java.transaction.xa,java.logging,java.xml.crypto,
jdk.jfr,jdk.internal.md,jdk.net,java.naming,jdk.internal.ed,java.prefs,
java.net.http,jdk.compiler,jdk.internal.opt,jdk.jconsole,jdk.attach,
jdk.internal.le,java.management,jdk.jdwp.agent,jdk.internal.jvmstat,
java.instrument,jdk.management,jdk.security.auth,java.scripting,jdk.jartool,
java.management.rmi
```

### Generating a runtime using jlink with ALL-MODULE-PATH no longer seems to work

When I run `jlink --add-modules ALL-MODULE-PATH --output myimage` I get:

```output
Error: --module-path option must be specified with --add-modules ALL-MODULE-PATH
```

The relevant upstream OpenJDK change is
[JDK-8345259](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8345259). Prior to JDK 24,
using `--add-modules ALL-MODULE-PATH` was equivalent to `--add-modules
ALL-MODULE-PATH --module-path $JAVA_HOME/jmods` which essentially meant to
create a runtime with *all* JDK modules. If this is what you intended to get a
"smaller" runtime, then a similar result could be achieved by:

1. Taking a JDK 24 Eclipse Temurin installation, copy it to a new location.
   Note that it already doesn't include the `jmods` folder.
2. Removing the `src.zip` file from the `lib` folder (~51 MB)

If you are really interested in smaller custom runtimes, however, you should
not include *all* JDK modules. I.e. consider using explicit modules in
`--add-modules` clause instead.

### Without JMODs I won't be able to cross-link a platform-foreign JDK

As mentioned in the [JEP's](https://openjdk.org/jeps/493) "Restrictions"
section, the default JDK tarball download of Eclipse Temurin 24 is not
sufficient to create a custom runtime for a **different** platform other than
the one driving `jlink` for the lack of included JMODs. For example, creating a
runtime on Linux x64 for the Windows x64 platform.

For those use-cases you can download the JMODs for a given Eclipse Temurin
release via the Adoptium API and use them to generate a JDK for the desired
platform.

For example, to generate a Windows x64 JDK on Linux x64 you could use the
following sequence of commands (in a bash terminal):

```bash
$ mkdir jdk-24.0.2 jdk-24.0.2-win-x64-jmods
$ curl -OJLs https://api.adoptium.net/v3/binary/latest/24/ga/linux/x64/jdk/hotspot/normal/eclipse # Linux x64 JDK
$ pushd jdk-24.0.2
$ tar -xf ../OpenJDK24U-jdk*.tar.gz --strip-components=1
$ popd
$ curl -OJLs https://api.adoptium.net/v3/binary/latest/24/ga/windows/x64/jmods/hotspot/normal/eclipse # Windows x64 JMODs
$ pushd jdk-24.0.2-win-x64-jmods
$ unzip -d tmp ../OpenJDK24U-jmods*.zip
$ mv tmp/jdk-24*jmods/*.jmod .
$ rmdir tmp/jdk-24*jmods
$ rmdir tmp
$ popd
$ pushd jdk-24.0.2
$ ./bin/jlink --module-path ../jdk-24.0.2-win-x64-jmods \
            --add-modules ALL-MODULE-PATH \
            --output ../jdk-24.0.2-x64-win
$ popd
$ ./jdk-24.0.2-x64-win/bin/java.exe --version
./jdk-24.0.2-x64-win/bin/java.exe: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error
```

This downloads the JDK 24.0.2 general availability release of Eclipse Temurin
for the x64 Linux platform via the Adoptium API and extracts it using the `tar`
and `unzip` utilities to folder `jdk-24.0.2`, and `jdk-24.0.2-win-x64-jmods`
respectively. The JMODs for platform x64 Windows are then available in folder
`jdk-24.0.2-win-x64-jmods` next to the `jdk-24.0.2` folder for `jlink` to pick
them up. Then `jlink` from the `jdk-24.0.2` installation is invoked telling it
to use a module path of `jdk-24.0.2-win-x64-jmods` and adding the
`ALL-MODULE-PATH` argument to `--add-modules` will tell jlink to use all
modules from the x64 Windows JMODs and will assemble the x64 Windows JDK in
folder `jdk-24.0.2-x64-win`. The result in `jdk-24.0.2-x64-win` will of course
not run on the host platform - x64 Linux. It would need to be transferred to a
x64 Windows machine for it to be run.
