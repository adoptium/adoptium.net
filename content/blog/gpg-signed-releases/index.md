With the latest releases from July 2022 (8u342, 11.0.16, 17.0.4 and 18.0.2)
we provide GPG signatures along with our releases which you can use to
verify that the downloads you have are genuine and have not been tampered
with since we built them. This gives a quick crib sheet of what you need to
do to verify the downloads.

## What is GPG signing?

In the use case we are talking about here, GPG signing is a cryptographic
process whereby a private/public keypair is used to confirm that a file has
not been tampered with between when it was published and it being delivered
to the end user. The private key is used by Adoptium to produce the
signature file which can be downloaded along with the OpenJDK binaries, and
the public key can be obtained by you and used to verify the the signature
is valid, proving the integrity of the file and also that it was signed by
Adoptium and not modified by a third party.

## The download site already provides SHA256 checksums. Why would I need this?

While going into the details of public key encryption is beyond the scope of
this article, if there was a man in the middle attack that resulted in the
downloads you receive being compromised, then the corresponding SHA
checksums could also be compromised. GPG signing avoids this issue by using
a separately certified signature which you can initially trust and then
verify subsequent downloads.

## What do I need to do to obtain the signatures?

The link to the signatures is provided in the metadata for our releases. In
the following examples I will use JDK17 but you can change the calls
appropriately for other versions:

The metadata that contains the URL of the signature file can be obtained
as follows:

`curl 'https://api.adoptium.net/v3/assets/feature_releases/17/ga' > adopt.json`

Once you've downloaded that you need to extract the `link` and
`signature_link` entries using your preferred JSON parsing tool. The
information you want is in the `binaries[0].package.link` and
`binaries[0].package.signature_link` section of the file for the most recent
version.

The following example uses the [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) command-line JSON
parsing tool to pull out the information for Linux/x64 and download the
product and the GPG signature using the `curl` command (change accordingly
for other platforms)

```bash
jq '.[0].binaries[] | select(.architecture=="x64") | select (.os=="linux") | select (.image_type=="jdk") .package.link' adopt.json | xargs curl -LO
jq '.[0].binaries[] | select(.architecture=="x64") | select (.os=="linux") | select (.image_type=="jdk") .package.signature_link' adopt.json | xargs curl -LO
```

Note that as mentioned in the previous section, we also provide the
sha256sums which can be obtained from the JSON file with

```bash
jq '.[0].binaries[] | select(.architecture=="x64") | select (.os=="linux") | select (.image_type=="jdk") .package.checksum' adopt.json
```

The SHA checksums can be verified against the output from running one of the
following commands depending on your operating system:

- Windows: `certUtil -hashfile file SHA256`
- MacOS: `shasum -a 256 file`
- UNIX/Linux: `sha256sum file`

The SHA checksum allows you to verift that the download has occurred without
errors, and the GPG checksum additionally verifies the binaries are those
released by the Adoptium project.

## How do I verify the signatures once I have them?

You will need to have the `gpg` tool installed in order to verify the
signatures. You can then run the following command to check the signature by supplying the signature file and the corresponding file which the signature is for e.g.:

`gpg --verify OpenJDK17U-jdk_x64_linux_hotspot_17.0.4_8.tar.gz.sig OpenJDK17U-jdk_x64_linux_hotspot_17.0.4_8.tar.gz`

If you do not currently have the Adoptium project's public signing key you will get a message such as this:

```output
gpg: directory '/home/sxa/.gnupg' created
gpg: keybox '/home/sxa/.gnupg/pubring.kbx' created
gpg: Signature made Mon Jul  4 18:20:31 2022 UTC
gpg:                using RSA key 3B04D753C9050D9A5D343F39843C48A565F8F04B
gpg: Can't check signature: No public key
```

To resolve this message you need to acquire the public key that was used to
sign the binaries. You can download it from a trusted GPG server, for
example to use the Ubuntu key servers run this command:

`gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 3B04D753C9050D9A5D343F39843C48A565F8F04B`

If you then run the verify command you will get a message indicating that the newly imported key has not been trusted:

```output
gpg: Good signature from "Adoptium GPG Key (DEB/RPM Signing Key)
<temurin-dev@eclipse.org>" [unknown] gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified
with a trusted signature!  gpg: There is no indication that the signature
belongs to the owner.
```

While the "Good signature" message gives you some
confidence that the download is valid, to fully trust the certificate and
remove the final warning you can run the following then follow the prompts
to grant ultimate trust to it:

```bash
gpg --edit-key 3B04D753C9050D9A5D343F39843C48A565F8F04B trust
```

The verification should then succeed as follows:

```output
gpg: Signature made Mon Jul  4 18:20:31 2022 UTC
gpg:                using RSA key 3B04D753C9050D9A5D343F39843C48A565F8F04B
gpg: checking the trustdb
gpg: marginals needed: 3  completes needed: 1  trust model: pgp
gpg: depth: 0  valid:   1  signed:   0  trust: 0-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 1u
gpg: Good signature from "Adoptium GPG Key (DEB/RPM Signing Key) <temurin-dev@eclipse.org>" [ultimate]
```

## OK I know what commands to run, but what are the implications of those steps?
