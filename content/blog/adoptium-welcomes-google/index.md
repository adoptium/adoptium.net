### Adoptium welcomes Google

Earlier this week Google announced that they have joined the Adoptium working group and are making Temurin available across Google Cloud Platform (GCP) products and services.

Cameron Balahan, Senior Product Manager at Google Cloud, [shared the news](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iG2xyaMQkA&t=436s) at the recent Google Cloud Next '22 Event as part of the session entitled "5 reasons why your Java apps are better on Google Cloud" alongside co-host Aaron Wanjala.

### Adoptium working group

Google are the latest company to join Alibaba Cloud, Azul Systems, Huawei, Karakun, Microsoft, and Red Hat as [Strategic Members](https://adoptium.net/members/) of the Adoptium working group. Strategic members are organizations that view Adoptium's technology as critical to their future, and are investing significant resources to sustain and define the core activities that are the responsibility of the working group.

The goals of the working group include ensuring that Adoptium Temurin remains a high-quality, secure, and trusted Java distribution for developers and enterprise users alike. Cloud companies and modern organizations dependent upon Java recognise that Adoptium gives them assurances for long term availability of Java that is free to use everywhere, and a direct say in the quality and resiliancy of their Java runtimes used in production.

### Heightened compatibility and security testing

In his announcement, Cameron Balahan said:

> "I'm pleased to announce that Google has joined the Eclipse Adoptium Working Group, a consortium of leaders in the Java community and makers of the Temurin build of OpenJDK. Temurin is one of the world's most popular JDK distributions certified by Adoptium for heightened compatibility and security testing. As a member of Adoptium Google will make Temurin available across GCP products and services, providing Java customers the highest standard of enterprise security and more opportunities to create integrated security-focused solutions. We're excited for you to try it out."

Every release of Temurin has passed [Java SE compatibility tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_Compatibility_Kit) for conformity to standards in addition to the rigorous [Eclipse AQAvit](https://adoptium.net/aqavit) verification suite for added confidence of quality. Adoptiumâ€™s Java SE binaries are always free to use at no cost under an open source license, and are production-ready for the most demanding environments.

Adoptium's AQAvit quality programme not only checks functional correctness of the runtime, but also puts each release under long-running stress workloads, checks the runtime performance characteristics, tests compatibility with open source libraries, and tests that a range of known security vulnerabilities have been fixed before awarding a pass.

### Further information

Adoptium is excited to welcome Google to the working group and project work and we look forward to accelerating our shared goals together.

Organizations interested in joining the Adoptium working group are invited to discuss their options with the [membership team](https://adoptium.net/join) in the first instance. Everyone is welcome to participate in Adoptium projects by joining the conversation on our [Slack channel](https://adoptium.net/slack).
