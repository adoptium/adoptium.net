[A few months ago](https://adoptium.net/blog/2023/08/early-access-builds)
we switched from producing semi-nightly builds of the head of our
repositories to building from upstream tags for JDK21+.  We have now
switched all of the currently supported repositories over to the same
mechanism so jdk8u, jdk11u, and jdk17u are also now building and publishing
from the upstream early access tags.  This will also include our
“evaluation” platforms - currently Windows on 64-bit Arm and Linux on
riscv64.

## How often do new tags come out?

The tags are typically created upstream once a week so you should expect
that our early access builds will be triggered and published on that
cadence.  We are running our full set of tests on each build too, although
unlike our formal GA releases we will not tie the publishing of these to the
results of the test runs - early access builds should be considered untested
and not for production use.  The early access builds will typically come out
towards the end of each week and for those of you in the adoptium
slack/matrix channels there are daily status posts regarding the health of
these builds.

By building and providing these early access builds from tags instead of the
head of the default branch we can more easily work with the upstream openjdk
project to identify the contents of a specific builds when providing bug
reports and reproductions.

## How do I get the early access builds?

You can obtain the tagged early access builds from [the
download page](https://adoptium.net/temurin/nightly/) or the API
using a URL such as the following, changing the operating system and
architecture for your needs.  Note that if you are accessing these URLs
using curl you will need to add the -L option to dereference the API’s
redirects:

- https://api.adoptium.net/v3/binary/latest/21/ea/linux/aarch64/jdk/hotspot/normal/adoptium

At the time of writing this will provide you with jdk-21.0.3+3.  If you want
a previous build to compare with then you can specify a particular version
directly when calling the API, for example this will retrieve jdk-21.0.3+2
from the previous week:

- https://api.adoptium.net/v3/binary/version/jdk-21.0.3+2-ea-beta/linux/aarch64/jdk/hotspot/normal/adoptium

Also while it is not the recommended way to retrieve them you can also find
the releases named with an ea-beta suffix directly on the GitHub releases
pages such as

- https://github.com/adoptium/temurin21-binaries/releases?q=ea-beta&expanded=true

the release names in there correspond with the part of the API URL after
“/version/” in the API example above.

Please note that early access builds are not made available as rpm/deb or
container images.

## Can I tell what's changed in each tagged build from the previous one?

Yes you can!  Since the tags are generally produced on a weekly cadence
there typically aren't too many commits between the releases, so if you
detect a problem there will only be a small number of commits that may have
caused it.  A query such as this:

- https://github.com/adoptium/jdk21u/compare/jdk-21.0.3+2_adopt...jdk-21.0.3+3_adopt

will show the commits between 21.0.3+2 and 21.0.3+3.  Since our source is as
clean as possible from upstream openjdk, the following URL using the
upstream openjdk repository will typically give the same output:

- https://github.com/openjdk/jdk21u/compare/jdk-21.0.3+2...jdk-21.0.3+3

From the command-line if you have a clone of our repository you can use
these comments to get the list of commits and or the full source code diff:

```sh
git log jdk-21.0.3+2_adopt..jdk-21.0.3+3_adopt
git diff jdk-21.0.3+2_adopt..jdk-21.0.3+3_adopt
```

## Release Candidate builds

Since we are now producing builds explicitly from the tags, this means that
when a build is declared as a release candidate for an upcoming release, you
can download a Temurin early access build corresponding to that version on
each of our platforms.  At the time of writing jdk-22+36 has been declared
release candidate 2 (jdk-22+35 was RC1) for the upcoming JDK22 release so
using similar queries to those referenced earlier it can be downloaded from:

- https://api.adoptium.net/v3/binary/version/jdk-22+36-ea-beta/linux/aarch64/jdk/hotspot/normal/adoptium

## Why am I not seeing early access builds for the latest release?

There is one caveat for producing early access builds using this procedure.
The process relies on the party maintaining the upstream version to perform
the tagging in public.  If those tags aren't visible in public, we have no
way to build from an invisible tag.  This usually happens for the time
period when new major JDK versions get released and subsequent quarterly
security updates for those releases are being handled (usually by Oracle).
For example between JDK `22` GA, `22.0.1` and `22.0.2` releases.  There are
no public tags available for early access tags `jdk-22.0.1+1`,
`jdk-22.0.1+2` and so on.  Should processes change some time in the future
we'd of course provide early access builds using the same process as for
other releases.

In the case of no publicly visible tags, however, we will revert to building
regularly from the head of the repository.  In these cases if you need to
know what is in each version you can determine which git SHA we built from
using corresponding SBoM artefact that can be downloaded from the API by
replacing “/jdk/” with “/sbom/” in the above URL.  For example:

- https://api.adoptium.net/v3/binary/version/jdk-22+36-ea-beta/linux/aarch64/sbom/hotspot/normal/eclipse?project=jdk

If you are using a GNU grep then this will easily show the commit:

- `curl -L https://api.adoptium.net/v3/binary/version/jdk-22+36-ea-beta/linux/aarch64/sbom/hotspot/normal/eclipse?project=jdk | grep -A1 "OpenJDK Source Commit"`

For more information on the adoptium API see the swagger-ui docs linked at https://api.adoptium.net

Please let us know if you find the early access builds useful.
