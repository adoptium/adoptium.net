## New and Noteworthy

### Windows aarch64 support

Starting with Eclipse Temurin versions 21.0.5 and 23.0.1, Windows aarch64 (ARM64) is now officially supported. This addition brings enhanced flexibility and performance improvements for developers working on ARM-based Windows systems. Users can now benefit from Temurin’s robust, high-performance JDK distribution on an expanded range of Windows hardware, continuing our commitment to broad platform compatibility and support for modern architectures.

### Windows Updated Microsoft STL Redistributable Included in Eclipse Temurin

We have addressed an issue in Eclipse Temurin regarding the inclusion of an outdated Microsoft STL redistributable (`msvcp140.dll`) in the JDK's bin directory, as noted in [issue #3887](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-build/issues/3887). This issue led to crashes for applications using C++ libraries from Java that relied on the updated mutex behavior in the latest Microsoft toolset. The outdated DLL version caused mutex initialization errors, impacting multi-threaded functionality. With this fix, Temurin now includes the latest Microsoft redistributables, ensuring compatibility and stability for applications requiring the updated runtime.

### Missing AIX 8u432 Release

The AIX build for Eclipse Temurin 8u342 has been temporarily skipped due to a compilation error introduced in the upstream OpenJDK codebase. We have reported the issue in [JDK-8342822](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8342822) and are actively working toward a resolution. We anticipate that the AIX JDK8u build will be available in the next quarterly release.

### Container Updates

#### GPG Verification Added to Eclipse Temurin images

This release introduces GPG verification for Eclipse Temurin container downloads, adding integrity and authenticity checks for greater security. As part of this enhancement, the `gnupg` package is now included in all Ubuntu and Alpine-based container images, which could be a breaking change for some workflows. This adjustment ensures that users receive verified binaries but may impact containers that previously operated without gnupg installed. For further details, refer to [PR #673](https://github.com/adoptium/containers/pull/673).

#### General availability of RISC-V container images

In this release, we are introducing support for RISC-V (riscv64) architecture with new Docker images for Eclipse Temurin, available from JDK 17 onwards. This addition enables broader compatibility and performance on RISC-V platforms, furthering our commitment to supporting diverse architectures in the open-source ecosystem.

#### Changes to Docker image external CA certs handling

A recent fix has been applied across all eclipse-temurin container tags to resolve an issue with the `__cacert_entrypoint.sh` script during certificate renewals. Previously, the script generated certificate aliases using only the Subject CN, which led to alias duplication errors when both old and new intermediate certificates with the same CN were present. This affected the keytool import process, causing it to fail. The fix now appends the certificate's serial number to the alias if a duplicate CN is detected, ensuring unique aliases and allowing both certificates to coexist during transitional periods without error.

See more details about the fix [here](https://github.com/adoptium/containers/pull/642).

#### (Re)Introduction of Windows Nanoserver images for JDK23

With the release of Eclipse Temurin 23.0.1, we are pleased to announce that Windows NanoServer images are now available, though this was skipped for the initial JDK 23 release. Currently, when running JDK 23+37 on Windows NanoServer containers, users may encounter the warning:

```output
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM warning: Failed to determine whether the OS can retrieve version information from kernel32.dll: The system cannot find the file specified
```

This warning is due to an ongoing issue with kernel version retrieval, and we anticipate it will be resolved in JDK 23.0.2. For more details, please refer to the [upstream issue](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8340383).
