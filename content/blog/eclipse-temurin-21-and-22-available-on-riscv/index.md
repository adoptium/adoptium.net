In the ever-expanding tech landscape, compatibility and accessibility are key. Today, we're excited to announce a significant advancement in the Java ecosystem: the availability of Eclipse Temurin 21 and Eclipse Temurin 22 on RISC-V. This achievement stems from a collaboration between Eclipse Adoptium and RISE, aimed at extending Java's reach to new platforms and audiences.

## Collaboration with RISE

Rivos's membership in both the [Adoptium Working Group](https://adoptium.net/members/) and [RISE Project](https://riseproject.dev) enabled this implementation. Our collaboration with the [RISE Project](https://riseproject.dev), an initiative to promote and advance commercial software readiness in the RISC-V ecosystem, has been pivotal in bringing Java to RISC-V. By combining our expertise and resources, we've tackled technical challenges and paved the way for Java to flourish on this emerging platform.

## Next Steps: Java 17 and 11

As we celebrate Eclipse Temurin’s availability on RISC-V, our focus shifts to the future. Eclipse Temurin 17 and 11 availability on RISC-V are in the works, and we're committed to ensuring smooth compatibility and performance optimization for RISC-V systems. These upcoming releases will further solidify Java's presence on this architecture, offering developers new avenues for innovation and growth.

## How to Get Started

Getting started with Java on RISC-V is now easier than ever. Visit the Adoptium site to access the latest [Java 21](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?arch=riscv64&version=21) and [Java 22](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?arch=riscv64&version=22) distribution tailored for RISC-V architecture, and expect the availability of .deb and .rpm packages very soon. Whether you're an experienced Java developer or exploring new territories, Adoptium provides the tools and support you need to embark on your journey confidently.

In conclusion, the availability of Java on RISC-V architecture marks a significant milestone in Java's evolution. Through collaboration and innovation, Adoptium and RISE have opened doors to new possibilities, empowering developers to leverage Java's power on diverse computing systems. Looking ahead, we're committed to advancing Java's compatibility and performance on RISC-V, ensuring its versatility and accessibility for the global developer community.
