## Eclipse AQAvit Project Scope

Eclipse AQAvit is a very active subproject of Eclipse Adoptium.  It is a project where a broad set of contributors come together around the topic of quality assurance.  By working together in an open-source project, the goal is to share in the workload and activities around testing OpenJDK distributions while additionally deduplicating effort, and freeing resources to innovate.  
Within the [scope of AQAvit](https://github.com/adoptium/aqa-tests/blob/master/docs/pages/Scope.md) falls both AQAvit verification, which is really a quality bar for OpenJDK binaries and development support especially for JDK developers.

### AQAvit Verification

Since AQAvit has developed both a consistent and open approach to measuring quality and a useful set of tools to benefit any JDK distributor, it has rapidly become the de facto standard by which companies can measure whether they trust the quality of the distribution they have selected to use.  This is why one of the criteria for listing a distribution in the [Adoptium marketplace](https://adoptium.net/marketplace/) includes the requirement to run and pass the [AQAvit verification suite](https://adoptium.net/docs/aqavit-verification/) of tests.

At this time, there are a good number of vendors listed in the Adoptium marketplace.  The marketplace API includes links to AQAvit results for the different distributions.  This serves as direct evidence of the quality of the binaries listed in the marketplace as well as an indicator of the open and transparent nature of the work.

### Developer Support

AQAvit provides [developer support](https://github.com/adoptium/aqa-tests/blob/master/docs/pages/Scope.md#2-developer-support) both JDK developers and Java application developers through its  publicly visible regular test runs, parameterization and bug tracking.  It is also a flexible system that allows for addition of new test material and for tuning to specific development needs.  [AQAvit was designed](https://github.com/adoptium/aqa-tests/blob/master/docs/pages/LayeredDesign.md) to integrate with various CI/CD tools, including GitHub Actions, making it a great choice for pull request testing and offering a continuous lens on the quality of code commits.

## 2024 AQAvit Plan

As part of the [AQAvit manifesto](https://github.com/adoptium/aqa-tests/blob/master/docs/pages/Manifesto.md) which is the set of criteria that we created to guide the work in the AQAvit project, we aim to continuously evolve alongside the continuously changing JDK implementations in order to stay relevant and useful.  The 'vit' in AQAvit from the Latin root and reminds us of this criteria to remain vital.  With that in mind, we have a great deal of cool work in the 2024 plan.

In our recent [AQAvit Community call](https://github.com/adoptium/aqa-tests/issues/5090), we gave an initial view of some targeted items of 2024, including some stretch goals such as enhanced developer support through the upcoming [Trestle initiative](https://github.com/adoptium/ci-jenkins-pipelines/wiki/Trestle-Initiative), additional tools to support AQAvit verification and much more.  You can find a list of 2024 features in the proposed agenda, and feel welcomed to join and/or put comments into upcoming [community calls](https://github.com/adoptium/aqa-tests/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22AQAvit+Meeting%22) to give your input into the activities of the AQAvit project.
