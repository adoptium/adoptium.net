## New and Noteworthy

### macOS min/max version updated to 11.00.00

As per [JDK-8317970](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8317970), the target macOS version for macosx-x64 is moved up to 11.x since macOS 10.x is no longer receiving updates and in alignment with macosx aarch64.

### ppc64 AIX and s390x Linux unavailable for JDK 22

Temurin jdk-22+36 for the AIX and s390x Linux platform are unavailable.  A small number of test failures indicated that there is need to investigate and update the upstream codebase.  We hope that these platforms on JDK 22 will be ready for release for the April CPU.

From the [analysis](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin/issues/35#issuecomment-2015308903) of these failures, and as part of the [release retrospective exercise](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin/issues/28), we see the opportunity to have caught these issues sooner. This may have resulted in earlier fixes that would have resulted in being able to release these platforms.  With the appropriate application of resources and collaboration, we can increase the likelihood of being able to publish the entire set of platforms 'in plan' successfully and without delay.
