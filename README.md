# Adoptium Website (Next.js)

This repository contains the Next.js rewrite of the [adoptium.net](https://adoptium.net) website, originally hosted at [github.com/adoptium/adoptium.net](https://github.com/adoptium/adoptium.net).

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the pages by modifying files in the `src/app` directory. The pages auto-update as you edit the files.
