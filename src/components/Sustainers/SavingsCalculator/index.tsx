            The average company* using Eclipse Temurin saves more than $1.6M
            annually. Isn&apos;t it time you invest in sustaining your savings?

            With the recent increase in licensing costs for paid Java SE
            options, we&apos;ve seen Temurin downloads surgeâ€”from over 75M in
            2023 to over 250M by the end of 2023, and doubling again to more
            than 500M by the end of 2024. This growth strongly indicates a
            significant transition away from paid Java options toward
            open-source solutions like Temurin. If your organization has
            made this migration, you&apos;ve likely experienced significant cost
            savings. Dedicate a portion of your savings to Temurin to invest
            in your corporate software supply chain by ensuring Temurin&apos;s
            long-term viability, enhance security, and accelerate faster
            releases for the Java community.
